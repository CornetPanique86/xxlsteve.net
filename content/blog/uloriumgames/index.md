### How it started

Ulorium Games was founded by [Sam0312](https://www.youtube.com/@Sam0312_) (Sam0312#3846 on discord) around the 4th of may 2020. It was preceded by a few other worlds like one named "Plantania" for which I had made an addon.

I was already friends with him at the time, so I would occasionally hop on and help him with the world.


### The rise

More and more people would know about the world, so Sam made a Discord server. We also started recruiting staff and our team became pretty big!

With an increasing staff and player base came an increasing number of minigames: sumo, FFA, Hikabrain (a game similar to MLG Rush) and TNT run.

A staff member named [endereyes202](https://www.youtube.com/@endereyes202) (endereyes202#5828 on discord) also made a logo and a banner for UloriumGames (because it used to be a random picture taken from Google)!
