# About me

Hi, I'm XXL Steve, also known as CornetPanique86.
I play both Minecraft Bedrock and Java but my english youtube channel is mostly Bedrock content.
If you'd like to check my social links or contact me, check out my [socials page](/socials)!

United Noobs
{{< /hanchor >}}

United Noobs is a team I founded to make Minecraft Bedrock content creation like maps, addons or resource packs.
Our content is published on [MCPEDL](https://mcpedl.com/user/cornetpanique86), [PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/united_noobs/) and [Addons for Minecraft](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kayenworks.mcpeaddons).

Unfortunately I'm not really interested in making maps or addons anymore, so the team is pretty much dead, sorry...

FAQ
{{< /hanchor >}}
*Frequently Asked Questions*

{{< spoiler "What video editor do you use?" >}}
I use [Davinci Resolve 17](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) (the free version), which I highly recommend!
{{< /spoiler >}}

{{< spoiler "What do you use to make addons? / How do I make an addon?" >}}
I primarly learnt how to make addons using [wiki.bedrock.dev](https://wiki.bedrock.dev), which is a community-driven website with tons of super helpful tutorials related to MCBE addons!
There also is [bedrock.dev](https://bedrock.dev) for resources and info while developping addons.

&nbsp;

I use the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor along with the [Blockception Minecraft Bedrock Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BlockceptionLtd.blockceptionvscodeminecraftbedrockdevelopmentextension), [Snowstorm Particle Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JannisX11.snowstorm) and [UUID Generator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=netcorext.uuid-generator) extensions.
[bridge.](https://bridge-core.app/) is also a very cool editor which is made for MCBE addons, but I'm personally more used to just using VSCode.

&nbsp;

For models, I use [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net/).

For image editing, I use [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/).

Website history
{{< /hanchor >}}

During the month of August 2022, I wanted to host Minecraft servers, and for that, I was planning to rent a {{< helphint "Virtual Private Server" >}}VPS{{< /helphint >}}. But that meant I could also host a website, and that kinda forced me to make one.

I started doing research on which framework to use and started learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) in late august.

The 22nd of November 2022, I put the site online for testing purposes.

The 25th of January 2023, I finally made the website public! Now, I make small updates every once in a while to fix the numerous bugs the site still has üòÅ
