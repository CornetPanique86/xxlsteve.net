No More Scary Cave Sounds is a resource pack that will change the cave sounds (yes, they got added in 1.16!) "ambient.cave" to "ambient" sounds like water lowing in a cave or birds singing.

This resource pack will change the ambient.cave sounds to less terrifying sounds (I hope so!). The cave sounds also play in superflat worlds & servers even though you're not in a cave so that could make your gameplay more "ambient".
