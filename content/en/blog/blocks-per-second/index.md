{{< boxnotice type="warning" >}}The old scripting API has been removed on Minecraft Bedrock since march 2022, replaced by the newer and better GameTest Framework. Therefore, this addon doesn't work on versions 1.18 or higher.{{< /boxnotice >}}

This script lets you calculate how many blocks you place every second! You can customise the time between every update: 1, 3, 5, 30 or 60 seconds! Singleplayer and Windows 10 only.

This addon/script is useful for knowing the average speed of bridging techniques, as it tells you how many blocks you place per second(s).

This addon only works for Windows 10 and in singleplayer with the additional modding capabilities feature enabled!

{{< image src="img/blocks-per-second-calculator-scriptwindows-10-only_2.png" caption="Enable Additional Modding Capabilities" >}}

To choose how many seconds you want between every update, click on the gear icon when the addon is applied to your world:

{{< image src="img/blocks-per-second-calculator-scriptwindows-10-only_4.png" caption="You can then choose a mode" >}}

In-game, the number of blocks you place every second(s) will appear on the actionbar:
