Help clean the ocean by collecting trash in Trash Collectors! A fun map to compete with friends and support MrBeast's and Mark Rober's #TeamSeas campaign! Collect trash, feed turtles and buy various powerups joined with MrBeast's outro song music in noteblocks!

What is Team Seas?
{{< /hanchor >}}

[#TeamSeas](https://teamseas.org/) is a global campaign to raise $30 million to remove 30 million pounds of plastic and trash from our ocean, rivers and beaches before 2022, led by [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarkRober/) and Jimmy ([MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBeast6000))!

{{< hanchor h="3" >}}
How to play:
{{< /hanchor >}}

Collect as much trash as you can by right-clicking it (or interaction text for mobile users) using your bag!

Increase the number of pounds you collect by getting more trash! The player with most pounds of trash collected wins. You can see how much pounds you have in the scoreboard on the right side of your screen:

{{< figure src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/137211/images/trash-collectors-teamseas_2.png" class="figurePopup imagePopup" >}}

Be careful, you can't "collect" turtles, anglerfish or normal fish!

However, you only have 3 minutes. If a player reaches the end before 0m30s, 30 seconds will be removed from the timer! Otherwise, the game finishes.

Types of trash:
{{< /hanchor >}}

- Plastic garbage (1 pound)
- Oil slick (3 pounds) - has a small chance of giving you seagrass. 
- Radioactive waste (5 pounds, but be careful! You can get irradiated...)

{{< hanchor h="4" >}}
Shop powerups:
{{< /hanchor >}}

If you feed the turtles with seagrass, you will earn money (visible in the game menu scoreboard), which you can spend in the shop.

- **Speed Booster**: swim 2x faster for 5 seconds! Price: *50 Money*
- **Disguised Trash**: spawn disguised trash that will remove 3 pounds to the player that tries to collect it! Price: *40 Money*
