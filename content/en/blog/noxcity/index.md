NoxCity was born around 2019, as the original name of NoxTown. NoxTown quickly became NoxCity, and the staff grew very big.

The purpose of the world was to build a city and roleplay in it. It had several addons adding furniture, but also cars and pets. Anyone could join and start building so the city became bigger and bigger.

I tried making a logo.
I also worked on an addon for NoxCity which added road blocks and custom music, and made a skin pack for it.

The discord server of Noxcity was born the October 4th, 2019.

On October 20th, the owner Nesoxis published his first video which took place in NoxCity:

I later made a video too showcasing the city the 3rd of february 2020:

But the start of the discord server was also the start of the end of NoxCity. It really ended when Nesoxis tried to convert NoxCity into a minecraft server. But it didn't work, and Noxcity became inactive.

On February 11th, 2021, Nesoxis created NoxCity 2's [discord server](https://discord.gg/ZjpkXj37tJ). It was the reborn of NoxCity, but it quickly became inactive too. Currently, NoxCity 2 is in pause.
