Welcome to Death Swap, a mini-game of trapping your friend! When the game starts, you have 8 minutes to gather resources. Then the swapping will begin! You and your friend will swap places! The goal is to kill your opponent! By United Noobs.

Death Swap is a famous game created by SethBling (here is his video) on the Java Edition of Minecraft. The goal is to kill your opponent by swapping places.
At the start of the game, you have 8 minutes to gather resources. After these 8 minutes, swapping will start. If you don't kill each other, swapping will continue every 5 minutes. Of course, the goal is to kill your opponent by trapping them!

&nbsp;

Here are examples of traps :

How to start the game
{{< /hanchor >}}

- Obviously, enter the map that you have imported to Minecraft
- You will find an orange cube. Press the button underneath the sign "Setup the game"
- It will setup the game. When that has finished, press the button again to start the game.
- If you get a bug during your gameplay, you can always press the button to reset the game!
