Minecraft Mansave: a kamikaze and lifeguards. If the kamikaze dies, he WON! If he's still alive after (by default in my addon) 2 minutes, he lost! This idea was originally invented by [McBirken](https://youtube.com/c/McBirken) and I ported it to Bedrock as an addon!

This is a simple function pack of McBirken's "Minecraft Manhunt but if I DIE, the Hunters LOOSE", AKA "Minecraft Mansave" (and yes I'm that XXL Steve guy that suggested this name) game.

{{< hanchor h="3" >}}
How to start:
{{< /hanchor >}}

To start the game, simply write */function start* in chat (you need at least 2 players to play the game)!

{{< figure src="https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/addons/6943/images/minecraft-mansave_2.png" caption="Start the game" class="figurePopup imagePopup" >}}

For the credits, */function credits*

And for help/instructions, */function help*

### How to be selected as the kamikaze when you start:

If you want to be automatically selected as the kamikaze, write */function kamikaze*

### How to change for how long the Lifeguards have to keep the Kamikaze alive to win:

If you think 2 minutes is too fast/slow, you can always change it! Write */scoreboard players set @s time yourTimeInSeconds* (note: you have to be the host for it to work. If someone else writes it, he has to write */scoreboard players set nameOfTheHost timeInSeconds*).
