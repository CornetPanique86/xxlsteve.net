Minecraft, but Speed and Jump progressively increase: the more you walk and jump, the faster you move and the higher you jump. This addon is very challenging, and with enough walking as well as jumping, you might reach the maximum levels!

This addon was inspired by Dream's "[Minecraft, But Speed Rises Every Second](https://youtube.com/embed//F---bdPvyLw)" video, except your speed slowly increases every time you move. It can be a fun challenge (although - I'll admit - quite annoying when your speed gets really high) to try out!

&nbsp;

This addon also features 3 different modes:

If you would like to reset your current speed and/or jump level, write ***/function reset*** in Minecraft chat.
