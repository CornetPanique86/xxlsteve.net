French Slap is a game where the goal is to knock the players off the map. Last player alive wins! But this map is in a "typically-French" theme/style, and with little twists!

- Baguette - enchanted with Knockback 2, use it to hit players off the map!
- Cheese Power - right-click on PC or long-tap on mobile to trigger it, and you will get a levitation effect for 1 second! 
- Power-up - it will randomly spawn in the game. It looks like a floating lucky block. Step in it and it will give you a random power-up (like an effect or additional Cheese Power).
