- [**CloudCannon's Hugo tutorial**](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-beginner-tutorial/) - it helped me so much to introduce myself to creating websites and to using Hugo (Hugo's documentation is hard to understand imo)!
- [**fixedsearch**](https://gist.github.com/Arty2/8b0c43581013753438a3d35c15091a9f) by Arty2 is the client side search tool used in my website (slightly tweaked) along with [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) as the searching library.
- [**typeface-minecraft**](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft) ([License](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft/blob/master/LICENSE)) by South-Paw is the fonts package I used for one of the Minecraft fonts.
- [**skinview3d**](https://github.com/bs-community/skinview3d) by bs-community is the 3D skin viewer tool used in my socials page.
- [**Dark Mode UI**](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dark-Mode) by Offroaders123 is the color palette I used for all the Minecraft style buttons on my site while in dark mode.
- [**Complementary Reimagined**](https://www.complementary.dev/reimagined/) - the shader used for my home page light mode background (Ulorium Games lobby).
- [**Overimagined Shaders**](https://github.com/isuewo/OverimaginedShaders) - the shader used for my home page dark mode background (NoxCity).
- [**IJAMinecraft's awesome website**](https://ijaminecraft.com/) - my website's style is highly inspired from it!
- **@endereyes202** ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@endereyes202), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/endereyes202), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/endereyes202)) - making some icons for [pixelart-icons](https://github.com/CornetPanique86/pixelart-icons)
