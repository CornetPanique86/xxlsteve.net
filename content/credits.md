- [**CloudCannon's Hugo tutorial**](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-beginner-tutorial/) - it helped me so much to introduce myself to creating websites and to using Hugo (Hugo's documentation is hard to understand imo)!
- [**typeface-minecraft**](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft) ([License](https://github.com/South-Paw/typeface-minecraft/blob/master/LICENSE)) by South-Paw is the fonts package I used for one of the Minecraft fonts.
- [**Dark Mode UI**](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dark-Mode) by Offroaders123 is the color palette I used for all the Minecraft style buttons on my site while in dark mode.
- [**Complementary Reimagined**](https://www.complementary.dev/reimagined/) - the shader used for my home page light mode background (Ulorium Games lobby)
- [**Overimagined Shaders**](https://github.com/isuewo/OverimaginedShaders) - the shader used for my home page dark mode background (NoxCity)
- [**IJAMinecraft's awesome website**](https://ijaminecraft.com/) - my website's style is higly inspired from it!
