How it started
{{< /hanchor >}}

Ulorium Games was founded by [Sam0312](https://www.youtube.com/@Sam0312_) (Sam0312#3846 on discord) around the 4th of may 2020. It was preceded by a few other worlds like one named "Plantania" for which I had made an addon.

I was already friends with him at the time, so I would occasionally hop on and help him with the world.

The rise
{{< /hanchor >}}

More and more people would know about the world, so Sam made a Discord server. We also started recruiting staff and our team became pretty big!

With an increasing staff and player base came an increasing number of minigames: sumo, FFA, Hikabrain (a game similar to MLG Rush) and TNT run.

A staff member named [endereyes202](https://www.youtube.com/@endereyes202) (endereyes202#5828 on discord) also made a logo and a banner for UloriumGames (because it used to be a random picture taken from Google)!

The maintenance
{{< /hanchor >}}

But for the next minigame, we wanted it to be bigger. We made a vote on the Discord server and the winner was: 'Bedwars'! 

And that's how the maintenance began. We built a map and Carl was responsible for coding the functionality of the minigame. 

At that time, I was starting to lose motivation to work on the realm, so I barely helped with anything. And obviously, a Bedwars minigame takes a long time to do (especially with the pain that are command blocks, chunk loading, etc...) and globally the whole staff team would log on less often than we used to. So that's how the progress for bedwars practically halted. I made a custom shop NPC and nothing else.

The whole minigame contained small bugs for pretty much every mechanic, and I was too lazy to fix it lol. I did find motivation to work on other features though: I improved the shop and the addon by adding cosmetics (custom 3D armor), and found a way to add custom "emojis", making Ulorium Games probably one of the first realms to have this feature before it got properly documented and used by most content creators :). Finally, I later added 2 minigames: block party and king of the hill (the latter being my own original twist to it). 

Aside from me, many work was done: a much bigger FFA arena was built by builders like EzraOcelot. And of course, biggest of all, a completely new lobby built primarily by everythingpro: with tons of attention to detail, it took him several months to finish it!

The fall
{{< /hanchor >}}

But after a year of maintenance, the Bedwars was still not done... and honestly, that's the excuse I used to insist that we should keep the realm on maintenance... because I simply was too lazy to do the work to open it, as I wanted a more grand opening than just letting people join, and knew there were still some bugs and improvement to do to the addon. Furthermore, I simply had completely lost motivation to work on Ulorium and instead wanted to concentrate on making videos and working other projects. So that's how eventually, I decided to leave the staff team, and that kinda meant the death of Ulorium Games as it anyway had barely any players anymore. I'm pretty sure Sam0312 (the owner) has now officially closed the realm, and I'd like to thank all the staff members who helped with building such a cool minigames world.

I've always wanted to make a "server" with a bunch of minigames, but I feel like if I kept on working on it, I wouldn't have the time to learn new and more advanced things as I would be stuck with using... command blocks. Anyway, thanks for taking the time and interest to read the story about a random MCBE world :D
