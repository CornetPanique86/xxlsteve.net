# [XXL Steve's website](http://www.xxlsteve.net)
This is the repository for my website's code.
My website is written in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Credits:
- [**CloudCannon's Hugo tutorial**](https://cloudcannon.com/community/learn/hugo-beginner-tutorial/) - it helped me so much to introduce myself to creating websites and to using Hugo (Hugo's documentation is hard to understand imo)!
- [**F77 Minecraft**](https://www.fontspace.com/f77-minecraft-font-f30628) ([License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/)) designed by 123467 is one of the Minecraft fonts used in my site.
- [**Dark Mode UI**](https://github.com/Offroaders123/Dark-Mode) by Offroaders123 is the color palette I used for all the Minecraft style buttons on my site while in dark mode.
- [**IJAMinecraft's awesome website**](https://ijaminecraft.com/) - my website's style is higly inspired from it!


## Copyright:
Honestly I don't mind if you get inspired from my website since I copied most of the base code from CloudCannon's Hugo tutorial :). If you're wondering my site's license is the [Creative Commons 0 1.0 Universal license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) but I honestly don't know anything about licenses lol
