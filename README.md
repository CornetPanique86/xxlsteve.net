## Copyright:

Honestly I don't mind if you get inspired from my website since I copied most of the base code from CloudCannon's Hugo tutorial :). If you're wondering my site's license is the [Creative Commons 0 1.0 Universal license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) but I honestly don't know anything about licenses lol
