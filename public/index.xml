Multi-instancing in a disk efficient way. Intro
I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all been frustrated because of a new problem with the official Minecraft launcher: crashes, logging in is not working&amp;hellip;
There are so many bugs that an entire article is dedicated for that on the Minecraft help center.
Looking for better solutions, I found the launcher MultiMC which I used for quite a while until I found PolyMC (which is a
fork of MultiMC), then migrated to Prism Launcher because PolyMC got compromised.</description></item><item><title>Pack86 (or Cornetpack)</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/resources/pack86/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 23:51:59 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/resources/pack86/</guid><description>My personal texture pack that I made when I reached 247 subs.

NoxTown quickly became NoxCity, and the staff grew very big.
The purpose of the world was to build a city and roleplay in it. It had several addons adding furniture, but also cars and pets. Anyone could join and start building so the city became bigger and bigger.
I tried making a logo. I also worked on an addon for NoxCity which added road blocks and custom music, and made a skin pack for it.</description></item><item><title>What is Ulorium Games?</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/uloriumgames/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 19:32:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/uloriumgames/</guid><description>How it started
Ulorium Games was founded by Sam0312 (Sam0312#3846 on discord) around the 4th of may 2020. It was preceded by a few other worlds like one named &amp;ldquo;Plantania&amp;rdquo; for which I had made an addon.
The first build of UloriumGames
I was already friends with him at the time, so I would occasionally hop on and help him with the world.
The rise
More and more people would know about the world, so Sam made a Discord server.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 19:57:14 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/privacy-policy/</guid><description>Privacy Policy

CloudCannon&amp;rsquo;s Hugo tutorial - it helped me so much to introduce myself to creating websites and to using Hugo (Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation is hard to understand imo)! fixedsearch by Arty2 is the client side search tool used in my website (slightly tweaked) along with Fuse.js as the searching library. typeface-minecraft (License) by South-Paw is the fonts package I used for one of the Minecraft fonts. skinview3d by bs-community is the 3D skin viewer tool used in my socials page.</description></item><item><title>Trash Collectors! #TeamSeas</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/trash-collectors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/trash-collectors/</guid><description>Help clean the ocean by collecting trash in Trash Collectors!

The old scripting API has been removed on Minecraft Bedrock since march 2022, replaced by the newer and better GameTest Framework. Therefore, this addon doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on versions 1.18 or higher.
This script lets you calculate how many blocks you place every second! You can customise the time between every update: 1, 3, 5, 30 or 60 seconds! Singleplayer and Windows 10 only.
This addon/script is useful for knowing the average speed of bridging techniques, as it tells you how many blocks you place per second(s).</description></item><item><title>Minecraft, but Speed and Jump Progressively Increase</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-speed-and-jump-progressively-increase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-speed-and-jump-progressively-increase/</guid><description>Minecraft, but Speed and Jump progressively increase: the more you walk and jump, the faster you move and the higher you jump. This addon is very challenging, and with enough walking as well as jumping, you might reach the maximum levels!
This addon was inspired by Dream&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Minecraft, But Speed Rises Every Second&amp;rdquo; video, except your speed slowly increases every time you move. It can be a fun challenge (although - I&amp;rsquo;ll admit - quite annoying when your speed gets really high) to try out!</description></item><item><title>Minecraft Mansave</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-mansave/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-mansave/</guid><description>Minecraft Mansave: a kamikaze and lifeguards. If the kamikaze dies, he WON! If he&amp;rsquo;s still alive after (by default in my addon) 2 minutes, he lost! This idea was originally invented by McBirken and I ported it to Bedrock as an addon!
This is a simple function pack of McBirken&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Manhunt but if I DIE, the Hunters LOOSE&amp;rdquo;, AKA &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Mansave&amp;rdquo; (and yes I&amp;rsquo;m that XXL Steve guy that suggested this name) game.</description></item><item><title>Minecraft, But Gravity Flips Every Minute</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-gravity-flips-every-minute/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-gravity-flips-every-minute/</guid><description>Every minute, gravity flips for 30 seconds!

This resource pack will change the ambient.cave sounds to less terrifying sounds (I hope so!). The cave sounds also play in superflat worlds &amp;amp; servers even though you&amp;rsquo;re not in a cave so that could make your gameplay more &amp;ldquo;ambient&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>A Little Simple Spleef Game</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/spleef/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/spleef/</guid><description>Just a little, simple Spleef game.
