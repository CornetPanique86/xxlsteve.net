Ulorium Games was founded by Sam0312 (Sam0312#3846 on discord) around the 4th of may 2020. It was preceded by a few other worlds like one named &amp;ldquo;Plantania&amp;rdquo; for which I had made an addon.
The first build of UloriumGames
I was already friends with him at the time, so I would occasionally hop on and help him with the world.
The rise
More and more people would know about the world, so Sam made a Discord server.</description></item></channel></rss>
