The old scripting API has been removed on Minecraft Bedrock since march 2022, replaced by the newer and better GameTest Framework. Therefore, this addon doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on versions 1.18 or higher.
This script lets you calculate how many blocks you place every second! You can customise the time between every update: 1, 3, 5, 30 or 60 seconds! Singleplayer and Windows 10 only.
This addon/script is useful for knowing the average speed of bridging techniques, as it tells you how many blocks you place per second(s).</description></item><item><title>Minecraft, but Speed and Jump Progressively Increase</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-speed-and-jump-progressively-increase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-speed-and-jump-progressively-increase/</guid><description>Minecraft, but Speed and Jump progressively increase: the more you walk and jump, the faster you move and the higher you jump. This addon is very challenging, and with enough walking as well as jumping, you might reach the maximum levels!
This addon was inspired by Dream&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Minecraft, But Speed Rises Every Second&amp;rdquo; video, except your speed slowly increases every time you move. It can be a fun challenge (although - I&amp;rsquo;ll admit - quite annoying when your speed gets really high) to try out!</description></item><item><title>Minecraft Mansave</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-mansave/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-mansave/</guid><description>Minecraft Mansave: a kamikaze and lifeguards. If the kamikaze dies, he WON! If he&amp;rsquo;s still alive after (by default in my addon) 2 minutes, he lost! This idea was originally invented by McBirken and I ported it to Bedrock as an addon!
This is a simple function pack of McBirken&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Manhunt but if I DIE, the Hunters LOOSE&amp;rdquo;, AKA &amp;ldquo;Minecraft Mansave&amp;rdquo; (and yes I&amp;rsquo;m that XXL Steve guy that suggested this name) game.</description></item><item><title>Minecraft, But Gravity Flips Every Minute</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-gravity-flips-every-minute/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/minecraft-but-gravity-flips-every-minute/</guid><description>Every minute, gravity flips for 30 seconds!

This resource pack will change the ambient.cave sounds to less terrifying sounds (I hope so!). The cave sounds also play in superflat worlds &amp;amp; servers even though you&amp;rsquo;re not in a cave so that could make your gameplay more &amp;ldquo;ambient&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>A Little Simple Spleef Game</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/spleef/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 12:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/spleef/</guid><description>Just a little, simple Spleef game.
