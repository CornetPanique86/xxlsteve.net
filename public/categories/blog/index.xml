Multi-instancing in a disk efficient way. Intro
I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all been frustrated because of a new problem with the official Minecraft launcher: crashes, logging in is not working&amp;hellip;

NoxTown quickly became NoxCity, and the staff grew very big.
The purpose of the world was to build a city and roleplay in it. It had several addons adding furniture, but also cars and pets. Anyone could join and start building so the city became bigger and bigger.
I tried making a logo.
I also worked on an addon for NoxCity which added road blocks and custom music, and made a skin pack for it.</description></item><item><title>What is Ulorium Games?</title><link>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/uloriumgames/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 19:32:51 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xxlsteve.net/blog/uloriumgames/</guid><description>How it started
Ulorium Games was founded by Sam0312 (Sam0312#3846 on discord) around the 4th of may 2020. It was preceded by a few other worlds like one named &amp;ldquo;Plantania&amp;rdquo; for which I had made an addon.
The first build of UloriumGames
I was already friends with him at the time, so I would occasionally hop on and help him with the world.
The rise
More and more people would know about the world, so Sam made a Discord server.</description></item></channel></rss>
