Multi-instancing in a disk efficient way. Intro
I think we&amp;rsquo;ve all been frustrated because of a new problem with the official Minecraft launcher: crashes, logging in is not working&amp;hellip;
There are so many bugs that an entire article is dedicated for that on the Minecraft help center.
Looking for better solutions, I found the launcher MultiMC which I used for quite a while until I found PolyMC (which is a
fork of MultiMC), then migrated to Prism Launcher because PolyMC got compromised.</description></item></channel></rss>
