Therefore, this addon doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on versions 1.18 or higher. This script lets you calculate how many blocks you place every second!

This addon was inspired by Dream&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Minecraft, But Speed Rises Every Second&amp;rdquo; video, except your speed slowly increases every time you move. It can be a fun challenge (although - I&amp;rsquo;ll admit - quite annoying when your speed gets really high) to try out!</description></item></channel></rss>
